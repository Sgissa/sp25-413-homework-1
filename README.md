## Assignment 1: WordPress Site Setup

### WordPress Usage & Architecture

I love the way WordPress works. It's like constructing a building and laying the content brick by brick. From this analogy the bricks are the difffrent blocks you can select to use for various diffrent content. The blocks are basic things we would normally program like: "lists", "tables", etc. It doesn't stop there, once you select a block you can edit the block to how you want to use it. WordPress automatily takes care of things like spacing and responsiveness.

### WordPress Site Setup

The site set up isn't to complex. The main is to make sure your using the right PHP version, Web server, and Database. Then you need to create an account for the admin access. Then from there the set up is set you can login and start working on your site. Apps like LocalWp help facilitate this whole process. And from the local app you can access VS code and your site easily.
